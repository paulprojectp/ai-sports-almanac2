# AI Sports Almanac

This project collects the current slate of MLB games from [Dratings.com](https://www.dratings.com/predictor/mlb-baseball-predictions/),
sends the matchups to four different LLM providers, stores the predictions in MongoDB and
updates `index.html` with the latest results.  A GitHub Action runs the process every
six hours so the site stays up to date.

**Predictions are generated by AI and are for entertainment purposes only. Do not use for betting advice.**

## Prerequisites

Create a `.env` file in the repository root (or copy from `.env.example`) and populate
these variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net
MONGODB_DB_NAME=ai-sports-almanac
DATA_SOURCE_URL=https://www.dratings.com/predictor/mlb-baseball-predictions/
```

`MONGODB_DB_NAME` controls which database the predictions are stored in.  The default
is `ai-sports-almanac` if the variable is omitted.

The prediction service and the demo page both use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for consistency.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and run the prediction script:

```bash
npm install
node scripts/llm-integration/fetch-and-predict.js
```

The script fetches games, queries the LLMs, writes predictions to MongoDB and updates
`index.html`.  Open the file in your browser to view the results.

## Automation

The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/update-predictions.yml` populates the
environment from GitHub secrets, runs the script and commits the updated HTML every
six hours.  Push changes to the repository and GitHub Pages will serve the latest
predictions.
