# AI Sports Almanac

This project collects the current slate of MLB games from [Dratings.com](https://www.dratings.com/predictor/mlb-baseball-predictions/),
sends the matchups to four different LLM providers and stores the predictions in MongoDB.
An Express server serves the static site and provides an API endpoint for the latest predictions. A GitHub Action runs the update script every six hours.
**Predictions are generated by AI and are for entertainment purposes only. Do not use for betting advice.**

## Prerequisites

Create a `.env` file in the repository root (or copy from `.env.example`) and populate
these variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_key
GROK_MODEL=grok-3-mini-fast-latest
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net
MONGODB_DB_NAME=ai-sports-almanac
DATA_SOURCE_URL=https://www.dratings.com/predictor/mlb-baseball-predictions/
```

`MONGODB_DB_NAME` controls which database the predictions are stored in.  The default
is `ai-sports-almanac` if the variable is omitted.

The update script queries **four** different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok and DeepSeek) for each game. Ensure all API keys are configured or the script will fall back to basic predictions.

The prediction service and the demo page both use OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model for consistency.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and run the prediction script:

```bash
npm install
npm run update
npm start
```
The `update` command fetches games, queries the LLMs and writes predictions to MongoDB.
`npm start` launches a local Express server on port 3000. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the results.

To generate the static files for GitHub Pages, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
The `build` script outputs the site to the `out/` directory.
## Automation
The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/update-predictions.yml` populates the
environment from GitHub secrets and runs the update script every six hours so the database stays current.
